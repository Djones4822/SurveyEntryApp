***THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED***

This app is constructed using python and tkinter with an oracle database backend. 

Relies on a database schema that follows very closely to this:

with some minor alterations to suit the needs of the app.

Todo: 
- Upload example images
- Convert database and functions to sqlite3 
- Build sample data so that the tool can be ran locally
- Refine code to be more OOP (this was built in a limited time for a specific need)
